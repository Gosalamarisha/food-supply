# Food Supply Chain Monitoring and Optimization System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and optimize the global food supply chain by leveraging **Python, PostgreSQL, and Tableau**. It helps understand food consumption patterns, weather impacts, and supply chain efficiency.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- **`data/`** â†’ Sample datasets
- **`scripts/`** â†’ Python scripts for ETL processing
- **`sql/`** â†’ PostgreSQL scripts for data modeling
- **`dashboards/`** â†’ Tableau visualizations
- **`docs/`** â†’ Project report & documentation

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, psycopg2)
- **PostgreSQL** (for Data Warehouse)
- **Tableau** (for Visualization)

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- Identified top food-producing countries based on yield.
- Analyzed wind speed impact on food transportation.
- Optimized supply chain distribution to reduce food waste.
